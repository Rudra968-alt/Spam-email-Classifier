Project Description â€“ Spam Email Classifier
The Spam Email Classifier is a machine learning-based project designed to automatically detect and classify incoming emails as either "spam" (unwanted or malicious) or "ham" (legitimate). This classification helps in filtering out unwanted emails, thereby enhancing user experience and security.
Spam detection is an essential application in email services to:
1. Prevent phishing and scams.
2. Reduce clutter in the inbox.
3. Protect users from malicious links or attachments.
4. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and supervised learning algorithms, this project builds a reliable spam detection system using a labeled dataset of real-world emails.

Tools and Libraries Used:
1. Python
2. Pandas, NumPy (data manipulation)
3. Scikit-learn (machine learning)
4. NLTK or spaCy (text preprocessing)
5. Matplotlib/Seaborn (data visualization)

Key Concepts Covered:
Text Preprocessing
Cleaning and transforming raw email text by removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, removing stopwords, and stemming/lemmatization.

Feature Extraction
Converting text into numerical features using techniques like:

Bag of Words (BoW)

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)

Label Encoding
Mapping target labels (e.g., "spam", "ham") into numerical format.

Model Building
Using classification algorithms like:

Naive Bayes

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
to train the model on preprocessed email data.

Model Evaluation
Measuring performance using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1 Score

Confusion Matrix
